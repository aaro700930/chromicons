# CHROMICONS

Handcrafted open source icons from LifeOmic. Ready to use in web, iOS, Android, and desktop apps. Support for SVG
and web font. Completely open source, MIT licensed, and built with
♥️ by the team at LifeOmic.

## Usage

### Web app (coming soon)

A web app is currently in the works allowing you to copy the SVGs directly.

### npm package

Chromicons is published to npm; however, it is not stable at the moment. We are planning on improving the build process so that web applications can import chromicons directly with minimal effort. The current configuration requires a webpack loader when dealing with React, for example. You can [track the progress of this effort here](https://github.com/lifeomic/chromicons/issues/3).
